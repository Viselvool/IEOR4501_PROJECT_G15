This project contains two Jupyter Notebooks called Top10 and Parking, which analyze the dataset of the 311-phone number for non-emergency service in New York City, delivering some specific answers. 
The Top10 file analyzes the top 10 causes of call in the 10471 zip code zone and calculates how many incidents of each of these causes have been in 2020. 
The Parking Notebook analyzes the number of illegal parking incidents in the 10471 zip code zone and compares the ratio of parking incidents over all types of incidents in the zip code zone to the overall parking incident rate. It returns a Boolean answering True if the ZIP code has a higher proportion than the overall rate of parking incidents and False otherwise.
